# MedChain AI: Rare Disease Diagnosis Network

*The First Mainnet Solution for Privacy-Preserving Medical AI on Internet Computer*

## 🎯 **Strategic Focus: Rare Disease Diagnosis**

**The Crisis**: **300 million people globally** suffer from rare diseases, representing **3.5-5.9% of the world's population**. Despite affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people individually, **72% are genetic in origin** and collectively create one of healthcare's most pressing challenges.

**Current Diagnostic Failure**: 
- **Average diagnosis time**: 4.7-5.6 years (women wait 5.4 years vs. 3.7 years for men)
- **Healthcare inefficiency**: Patients consult 7.3 physicians and 8+ healthcare professionals
- **Financial barriers**: 84.7% of physicians cite high testing costs as major obstacles
- **Market size**: $224.30 billion in 2024, projected to reach $527.05 billion by 2034

**Our Solution**: MedChain AI leverages Internet Computer's unique **on-chain AI capabilities** to create the world's first blockchain-native federated learning network for rare disease diagnosis, enabling hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing patient data.
