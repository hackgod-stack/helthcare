## ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAPS**

### **🔧 Missing Core Components (Major Issue)**

**Empty Directories:**
```
❌ canisters/privacy_engine/          (0 files)
❌ libs/federated_learning/           (0 files) 
❌ libs/medical_data/                 (0 files)
```

**Impact**: These are core to the value proposition and demo.

### **🌐 Web Application Issues (Major Issue)**
- **Server Not Running**: Development server stopped, app inaccessible
- **No Live Demo**: Cannot showcase the working system
- **Missing Integration**: Frontend not connected to backend canisters

### **🧪 Testing & Validation (Major Issue)**
- **No Test Suite**: Zero automated tests for critical medical AI system
- **No Data Validation**: Missing synthetic rare disease datasets
- **No Performance Benchmarks**: Cannot prove <2s inference claims

### **🔗 Integration Gaps (Medium Issue)**
- **No ICP Deployment**: Not actually deployed to mainnet as claimed
- **Missing IC Agent**: Frontend not connected to Internet Computer
- **No Threshold-ECDSA**: Integration exists in code but not functional
