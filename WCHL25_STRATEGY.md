# üèÜ MedChain AI: WCHL25 Execution Strategy for Maximum Impact

## **Executive Summary**

MedChain AI targets the most impactful rare disease diagnosis challenge with robust supporting evidence. The rare disease market presents an extraordinary opportunity with **300 million people globally affected**, experiencing an average diagnosis time of **4.7-5.6 years**, making this one of healthcare's most pressing challenges.

## **Market Validation: A Problem Worth Solving**

### **Scale of Impact**
The rare disease ecosystem represents a significant healthcare crisis disguised as individual "rare" conditions. While each disease affects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people, collectively they impact **3.5-5.9% of the global population**, with **72% being genetic in origin**. In the United States alone, rare diseases affect **30 million individuals**, highlighting the cumulative magnitude of this challenge.

### **Economic Opportunity**
The rare disease treatment market demonstrates explosive growth potential:
